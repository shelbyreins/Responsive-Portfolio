                I am an online student, looking to build a career from home. I enjoy traveling, yoga, walks on the beach and coffee chats. I was a military brat and moved all around the states during my childhood. 
                <br>
                Currently, I reside in Monterey, CA. After hearing many positive reviews about coding I figured why not give it a try. I have always loved mathematics and enjoyed the challenges the subject brought forth. I thrive to succeed in this field and am excited to learn a new concept.
